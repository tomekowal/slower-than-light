My attempt on idle game

I want to create an idle game like [Kittens Game](http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/),
[Cookie clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) or
[A Dark Room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/)

I like Kittens Game complexity, number of resources and mechanics based on seasons,
which force player to adapt strategy constantly.
I also like a Dark Rooms mechanics that prevents you from clicking furiously.

I want the game to  have a space theme.
The title "Slower than light" is a pun on very well known rouge like.
